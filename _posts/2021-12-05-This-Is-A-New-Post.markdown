		I decided I was going to buy a friend a keyboard. Rather than just buy
	one off the shelf I decided that I was going to try to create something
	special for him. He likes to play Minecraft and asked for a blue and
	red keys. He also asked for a platinum or gunmetal case. This will be
	simple to find I thought.
	
		I started to research to find out what I would need. Just get a case,
	PCB, switches, keycaps and a cable, seems manageable. I started with what
	size of keyboard I would get him. We deiced on a full size because space
	was not an issue and that is what he is used to. After some continued
	research I decided to get a metal case and hot swap switches, I did have
	a soldering iron but I decided that since I didn't have too much experience
	with it the hot swap switches would help create a better product. He said
	he wanted the switches to have a tactile bump but not make too much noise,
	I decided on cherry browns. Lastly, I found a set of red keys and another
	set of blue keys.
		
		So why didn't I stop there? Because when I added everything up I
	realized it was out of my price range. after looking around to see if
	I could get a better price I was still just outside of $300. Then I
	started to look at budget options. After looking around I realized
	buying a ready-made board and customizing it afterword's looked like
	a good option. I could start around $100 and upgrade it to what he
	would want. After looking at some options, all the ones that matched
	what he wanted were out of stock. So as of the current moment I am
	waiting to see if stuff gets back in stock.
			
		I hope to update this post in the future.
