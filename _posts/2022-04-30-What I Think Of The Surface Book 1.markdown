		Recently I bought a surface Book 1. I bought it to replace a HP windows tablet
	that I was using for basic tasks at work. I like the tablet form factor because
	I work with alot of different devices and sometimes there is not a good surface to
	work from. The Surface Book seems to be the best form factor for me because it is
	both a laptop and a table, not a tablet with a keyboard. The one I got has the I7,
	16GB of ram, 500GB SSD and the 965M GPU.
	
		I am not going to talk too much about the device its self, there are alot of
	reviews to tell you that. it feels well built, feels like a tank but the port
	selection is quit lack luster in 2022. If you need a usb c port you can get an
	adapter for the surface connect port, The device doesnt support thunderbolt but
	you can use a dongle to charge, connect a display, and connect usb or other
	devices.
		
		The performance is quite adiquate in 2022. While you can get better
	performing computers for cheap, I believe the comptuer makes up for it in
	other features. I will mention that I had issues with playing youtube videos
	in the brave browser. They would studder and hang every once in a while. The
	way I fixed it was going into windows settings and setting the gpu to the IGPU
	instead of the dedicated card. It also lets me remove the tablet with it open.
		
		I just got the computer today but I hope to keep updating this as I
	use the computer.
		
		Here is my update after owning it for several weeks. It apears the one
	I got has a bad battery in the clip board. I can't let it get too low
	on battery or it will shut down on me. The performance is fine for what
	I do. It's not a gaming powerhouse or a workstation, but since I have a
	mac mini for editing videos at work I dont have any issues for what I need
	it for. I love the keyboard and trackpad, The screen is amazing. I am using a
	usb c to surface connect adapter for charging and have had no issues. For how
	old it is it works amazing for my needs.

		I have been using it for over 6 months, It is running ubuntu great with a
	custom kernal. I have had no preformance issues and have even played some
	very light games at times. I find it great for day to day tasks. The only
	issue is that the screen seems to have a battery that is starting to have
	issues. If I push the tablet hard without the base, sometimes it might shut
	off, But only in tablet mode. I also find the lack of ports anoying at times.
	The only decent dock I can find is from microsoft and uses the surface
	connector. Overall I can recomend this device even in 2022.
