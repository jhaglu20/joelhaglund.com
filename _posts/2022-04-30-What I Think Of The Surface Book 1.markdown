		Recently I bought a surface Book 1. I bought it to replace a HP windows
		tablet that I was using for basic tasks at work. I like the tablet form 
	factor because since I work with alot of different devices and sometimes
	there is not a good surface to work from. The Surface Book seems to be the
	best form factor for me because it is both a laptop and a table, not a
	tablet with a keyboard. The one I got has the I7, 16GB of ram, 500GB SSD
	and the 965M GPU.
